# GitLazy README

Helper function to add/commit/push in one go.  Inspired by [Git-Urgent](https://github.com/ArafatHusayn/git-urgent/) and [Git-Add-And-Commit](https://github.com/ivangabriele/vscode-git-add-and-commit/).  Parts of this extension utilise code modified from the Git-Add-And-Commit extension, mainly [exec.ts](https://github.com/ivangabriele/vscode-git-add-and-commit/blob/master/src/helpers/exec.ts).

## Features

- Add, Commit, and Push in a single command, without being prompted for a commit message

## Requirements

If you have any requirements or dependencies, add a section describing those and how to install and configure them.

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `gitlazy.commitMessage`: Default commit message to use for `addCommitPush`, defaults to 'Update'

## Known Issues

Please log any issues on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/taddison/gitlazy/issues).
